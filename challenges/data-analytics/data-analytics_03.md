# Challenge 3

```
0 <= x <= 10
y1 = sin(x+2)
y2 = 5.cos((x/2)-1)
```

1. Make suitable array for x values and compute values for y1 and y2
2. Plot y1 and y2 on the same plot
3. Mark where y1 - y2 is maximum and minimum, what are the maximum and minimum values
4. What percent of data where difference between two y's is > 2
